# Discord Anonymous Confession Bot

## Overview

This is a Discord bot built with Discord.js v14 that allows users to submit anonymous confessions through slash commands. The bot supports both text and image confessions, implements rate limiting to prevent spam, and maintains audit logs for moderation purposes.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Language: French (user communicates in French)

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Discord Slash Commands**: Primary user interface through Discord's native slash command system
- **Ephemeral Responses**: Private feedback to users for validation errors and rate limiting

### Backend Architecture
- **Node.js Application**: Single-file entry point (`index.js`) that initializes the Discord client
- **Modular Command System**: Commands are loaded dynamically from the `commands/` directory
- **Utility Modules**: Separate modules for logging and rate limiting functionality

### Core Components
- **Discord.js Client**: Handles Discord API interactions with appropriate gateway intents
- **Command Handler**: Automatically discovers and registers slash commands
- **Rate Limiting System**: In-memory rate limiting with configurable windows and limits
- **Audit Logging**: File-based JSON logging system for confession tracking

## Key Components

### Command System
- **Confession Command** (`commands/confess.js`): Handles anonymous confession submissions
  - Supports text, images, or both
  - Validates content length and file types
  - Integrates with rate limiting and logging

### Utility Systems
- **Rate Limiter** (`utils/rateLimit.js`): 
  - In-memory tracking of user submission attempts
  - Configurable time windows and maximum attempts
  - Automatic cleanup of expired records
  
- **Logger** (`utils/logger.js`):
  - File-based JSON logging to `logs/confessions.json`
  - Maintains last 1000 confessions to prevent file bloat
  - Stores confession metadata for audit purposes

### Configuration Management
- **Static Configuration** (`config.json`): Centralized settings for:
  - Channel IDs and admin roles
  - Rate limiting parameters
  - Content validation rules (text length, image types/sizes)

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: User invokes `/confess` slash command with text and/or image
2. **Rate Limit Check**: System validates user hasn't exceeded submission limits
3. **Content Validation**: Text length and image format/size validation
4. **Confession Processing**: Content is formatted and posted to designated channel
5. **Audit Logging**: Confession details logged for moderation purposes
6. **User Feedback**: Confirmation or error message sent privately to user

## External Dependencies

### Discord.js Framework
- **Version**: 14.21.0
- **Purpose**: Discord API integration and bot functionality
- **Key Features Used**: Slash commands, embeds, file attachments, gateway intents

### Node.js Built-ins
- **File System (fs)**: For logging and configuration management
- **Path**: For file path resolution
- **HTTPS**: For image downloading and processing

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Configuration
- **Discord Bot Token**: Required via `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable
- **Client ID**: Required via `CLIENT_ID` environment variable for command registration

### File Structure Requirements
- **Logs Directory**: Automatically created at `logs/` for confession audit trail
- **Commands Directory**: Must exist with command modules for dynamic loading

### Operational Considerations
- **Memory Management**: Rate limiting data stored in memory (resets on restart)
- **File Growth**: Logging system automatically truncates to prevent disk space issues
- **Command Registration**: Slash commands deployed globally on startup
